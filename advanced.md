# Advanced

Thanks for your patience. Reading documentation is a tough job, so that we keep as simple as possible. Here is about the advanced level tutorial. In real-world integration, things become complicated and developers may need to do customizations. We hope to maintain a simple but highly configurable interface. Like in basic tutorial, we will go through step by step again.

+ Custom templates for SAML Request/Response
+ Scale with multiple Identity/Service Providers
+ Additional assertion validations
+ Metadata distribution
+ Configuration of Identity/Service Provider w/o metadata

If you have ideas and want more examples, please don't be hesitate to create an issue in our Github repository.
